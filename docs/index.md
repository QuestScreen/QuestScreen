**Quest Screen** is an app that displays images and information on a screen during pen & paper sessions.

It has been designed to be installed on a small board (e.g. Raspberry Pi) but you can also run in on your desktop machine or laptop.

It provides a web interface which enables the game master to modify the displayed information.
This web interface is responsive and can be operated from any device which provides a modern web browser â€“ smartphones, tablets, laptops etc.

Quest Screen allows you to manage multiple groups and persists the state of each group between sessions.
It allows you to modify presentation (colors, font etc.) per group and system.

A plugin API allows you to add modules that display any kind of additional information that is not covered by the modules provided by the core.
